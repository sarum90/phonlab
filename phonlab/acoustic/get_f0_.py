This function is an implementation of Drugman and Alwan's (2011) "Summation of 
Residual Harmonics" (SRH) method of pitch tracking.  The signal is downsampled to 
16 kHz, and inverse filtered with LPC analysis to remove the influence of vowel 
formants. Then harmonics are found in the spectrum of the residual signal.
Drugman and Alwan found that this technique provides an estimate of F0 that is 
robust when the audio signal is corrupted by noise. 

The f0 range is adaptively adjusted.

This function implements the 'approximate common denominator" algorithm proposed by Aliik, Mihkla and Ross (1984), which was an improvement on the method proposed by Duifuis, Willems and Sluyter (1982).  The algorithm finds candidate harmonic peaks in the spectrum, and chooses a value of f0 that best predicts the harmonic pattern.  One feature of this method is that it reports a voice quality measure (the difference in the amplitudes of harmonic 1 and harmonic 2).

Probability of voicing is given from a logistic regression formula using `rms`, the `h2h1` ratio, and Duifuis et al.'s harmonicity criterion `C`  to predict the voicing state as determined by EGG data using the function `phonlab.egg_to_oq()` over the 10 speakers in the ASC corpus of Mandarin speech. The prediction of the EGG voicing decision was about 86% correct.
Aliik et al. (1984) used a cutoff of C < 3.5 as a voicing threshold.

Parameters
==========
    y : ndarray
        A one-dimensional array of audio samples
    fs : int
        the sampling rate of the audio in **y**.
    f0_range : a list of two integers, default=[60,400]
        The lowest and highest values to consider in pitch tracking. The algorithm is not particularly sensitive to this parameter, but it can be useful in avoiding pitch-halving or pitch-doubling.
    l : float, default = 0.05
        Length of the pitch analysis window in seconds. The default is 50 milliseconds.  
    s : float, default = 0.005
        "Hop" interval between successive analysis windows. The default is 5 milliseconds
    prom : numeric, default = 5 dB
        In deciding whether a peak in the spectrum is a possible harmonic, this prominence value is passed to scipy.find_peaks().  A larger value means that the spectral peak must be more prominent to be considered as a possible harmonic peak, and thus the algorithm is less likely to report pitch values when the parameter is given a high value.  In general, 20 is a high value, and 3 is low.
    min_height: numeric, default = 0.6
        As a proportion of the range between the lowest amplitude in the spectrum and the highest, only peaks above `min_height` will be considered to be harmonics. The value that is passed to find_peaks() is: `amplitude_min + min_height*(amplitude_range)`. 

Returns
=======

        * f0 - estimate of the fundamental frequency
        * rms - rms amplitude in a low frequency band from 0 to 1200 Hz
        * h1h2 - the difference in the amplitudes of the first two harmonics (H1 - H2) in dB
        * C - harmonicity criterion (lower values indicate stronger harmonic pattern)
